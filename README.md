Java Access Bridge Sample
==============================

This is a really basic sample application on how to use the Java Access Bridge. It's able to read the entire control hierarchy of a java app and dump it to screen. If you're just starting out with the JAB this should be a good head start for whatever you need to do.

### To use the sample app: ###

* Install Java Access Bridge
* Open and run the project in eclipse
* Open Java app of interest
* Use Spy++ or some other tool to get the window handle to the java window (in hex format)
* Enter the windle handle into the sample app and click "Dump Control Hierarchy"
